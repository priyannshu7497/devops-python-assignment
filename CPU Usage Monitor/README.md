# CPU Usage Monitor üñ•Ô∏è

This is a simple Python script to continuously monitor CPU usage on a local machine.  
If the CPU usage exceeds a predefined threshold (default is 80%), the program displays an alert message in the terminal.

## üöÄ Features

- Monitors CPU usage in real-time
- Alerts when CPU usage crosses a specified threshold
- Runs indefinitely until manually stopped
- Includes error handling for robustness

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- psutil library

Install `psutil` using pip if not already installed:

```bash
pip install psutil

How to Use
